# Caching Data in Next.js

## Automatic Caching

Next.js, by default, automatically caches the returned values of fetch operations in the Data Cache.

## Data Cache

### What is data cache?

The data cache is a server-side cache that persists the result of data fetches across incoming server requests and deployments.

### Why is it required?

The data cache improves app performance and reduces costs by eliminating the need to re-fetch data from your data source with every request.

## Benefits of Data Caching

1. Improved Performance: Faster response times for subsequent requests
2. Reduced Server Load: Fewer calls to the data source
3. Cost Efficiency: Potential reduction in API calls or database queries

## Opting Out Of Caching

For individual data fetches, you can opt out of caching by setting the cache option to `no-store`.

Key points:

-   Once you specify the `no-store` option for a fetch request, subsequent fetch requests will also not be cached.
-   By default, Next.js will cache `fetch()` requests that occur before any dynamic functions (`cookies()`, `headers()`, `searchParams`) are used.
-   Next.js will not cache requests found after dynamic functions.

## Example of Opting Out

```javascript
const res = await fetch('https://...', { cache: 'no-store' });
```

## Considerations

-   Use caching judiciously based on your data's nature and update frequency.
-   For frequently changing data or user-specific information, consider opting out of caching.
-   Balance between performance benefits and data freshness when deciding caching strategies.

By understanding and effectively using Next.js's caching mechanisms, you can optimize your application's performance and resource usage.
