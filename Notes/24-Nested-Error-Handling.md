# Handling Errors in Nested Routes in Next.js

In Next.js, you can handle errors in nested routes by using `error.tsx` files. These files act as React Error Boundaries, allowing you to manage errors at various levels of your application's route hierarchy.

## Key Concepts

-   **Error Propagation**: Errors bubble up to the closest parent error boundary. This means that if an error occurs in a nested route, it will be caught by the nearest `error.tsx` file in the directory hierarchy.
-   **Granular Error Handling**: By placing `error.tsx` files at different levels within your route structure, you can achieve more granular error handling. This allows you to tailor error responses based on the specific segment of your application where the error occurred.

## Example Structure

Consider the following directory structure:

```
app
├── layout.tsx
├── error.tsx         // Handles errors for the entire app
├── dashboard
│   ├── layout.tsx
│   ├── error.tsx     // Handles errors for the dashboard segment
│   ├── stats
│   │   ├── page.tsx
│   └── settings
│       ├── page.tsx
│       └── error.tsx // Handles errors specifically for the settings segment
└── about
    ├── page.tsx
```

### Explanation

-   **Global Error Handling**: The `error.tsx` file at the root level (`app/error.tsx`) will catch errors for the entire application unless a more specific error boundary is defined in a nested segment.
-   **Segment-Specific Error Handling**: The `dashboard/error.tsx` file will handle errors for any routes under the `dashboard` segment, such as `dashboard/stats` and `dashboard/settings`, unless overridden by a more specific boundary.
-   **Nested Error Handling**: The `dashboard/settings/error.tsx` file provides error handling specifically for the `settings` segment, allowing for customized error responses in this part of the application.

## Benefits

-   **Tailored Error Responses**: By positioning `error.tsx` files at different levels, you can provide tailored error messages and recovery options for different parts of your application.
-   **Improved User Experience**: Granular error handling helps maintain a smooth user experience by isolating errors to specific segments and preventing them from affecting the entire application.

By strategically placing `error.tsx` files in your Next.js application's directory structure, you can effectively manage errors and enhance the robustness of your application.
