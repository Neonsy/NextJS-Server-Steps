# Dynamic Rendering in Next.js

Dynamic rendering is a server rendering strategy where routes are rendered for each user at request time.

## Key Features

- Routes are rendered individually for each user when requested
- Useful for personalized data or information only known at request time
- Ideal for:
  - News websites
  - Personalized e-commerce pages
  - Social media feeds

## How to Dynamically Render

Next.js automatically switches to dynamic rendering when it encounters a dynamic function during the rendering process.
The whole route will be dynamically rendered if any of these functions are used:

- `cookies()`
- `headers()`
- `searchParams`

## Dynamic Rendering Summary

1. **On-demand HTML Generation**: HTML is generated at request time
2. **Automatic Detection**: Next.js automatically switches to dynamic rendering when it encounters dynamic functions
3. **Personalization**: Great for rendering HTML personalized to a user (e.g., social media feed)
4. **Developer Flexibility**: Developers don't need to explicitly choose between static and dynamic rendering; Next.js selects the best strategy based on the features and APIs used in each route

## Benefits

- Allows for real-time, personalized content
- Handles data that changes frequently or is user-specific
