# Introduction

## What is Next.js?

Next.js is a **React framework** for building web applications.

## Why Use Next.js?

React is a library for building user interfaces, focused on the responsibility of the view layer of an application.
A proper application also has features like routing, data fetching, authentication, and more.

Next.js is a React framework that focuses on the backend. It includes features like:

-   **Routing**: Automatically handles navigation between pages.
-   **Optimized Rendering**: Supports both Server-Side Rendering (SSR) and Static Site Generation (SSG).
-   **Data Fetching**: Simplifies the process of getting data from APIs.
-   **Bundling and Compiling**: Efficiently packages your code for production.
-   **Modular Nature**: While you theoretically donâ€™t need additional packages, Next.js thrives when combined with other packages.

Learning Next.js simplifies the process of building a web application with:

-   **Routing**
