# Getting Started with Next.js

To begin your journey with Next.js, you'll need to have Node.js installed on your computer.
Node.js is a JavaScript runtime that allows you to run JavaScript on your machine, outside of a web browser.

## Installing Node.js

One popular way to manage Node.js versions is by using NVM (Node Version Manager).
For Windows users, [NVM Windows](https://github.com/coreybutler/nvm-windows) is a great option.
However, you can use any method you're comfortable with to install Node.js.

In this guide, we're using the latest LTS (Long Term Support) version of Node.js, which is currently v20.16.0 LTS.

## Creating a Next.js Project

To create a new Next.js project, you can use either npm (Node Package Manager) or pnpm (a faster alternative to npm).
Here's the command to create a new project:

```bash
npm create next-app@latest
```

or if you're using pnpm:

```bash
pnpm create next-app@latest
```

This command will start the process of creating a new Next.js project in your current directory.

## Project Setup Options

During the setup, you'll be asked a series of questions to customize your project:

1. **Project name**: Choose a name for your project (e.g., "learning-next")
2. **TypeScript**: Decide whether to use TypeScript, a typed superset of JavaScript
3. **ESLint**: Choose to include ESLint for code quality checks
4. **Tailwind CSS**: Opt to use Tailwind CSS for styling
5. **src/ directory**: Decide if you want to use a `src/` directory for your code
6. **App Router**: Choose whether to use the new App Router (recommended)
7. **Import alias**: Decide if you want to customize the default import alias

Answer these questions based on your preferences and project requirements.
Once you've made your choices, Next.js will set up your project with the selected options.
