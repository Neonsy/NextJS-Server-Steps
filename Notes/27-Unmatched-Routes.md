# Unmatched Routes in Next.js

Unmatched routes in Next.js refer to situations where the current URL does not map directly to a predefined route or slot.
This can occur during navigation within the UI or when a page is reloaded.

## Handling Unmatched Routes

### Navigation from the UI

- **State Retention**: When navigating within the UI, Next.js retains the previously active state of a slot, even if the URL changes. This ensures a seamless user experience where the content remains consistent despite changes in the URL.

### Page Reload

- **Default Content Search**: Upon page reload, Next.js searches for a `default.tsx` file within each unmatched slot. This file provides the default content that Next.js will render.
- **404 Error**: If the `default.tsx` file is missing in any unmatched slots for the current route, Next.js will render a 404 error, indicating that the content could not be found.

## The `default.tsx` File

The `default.tsx` file serves as a fallback mechanism in Next.js, providing content when a slot's active state cannot be retrieved from the current URL.

### Key Features

- **Customizable UI**: You have the flexibility to define the UI for unmatched routes in the `default.tsx` file. This can either mirror the content found in `page.tsx` or present an entirely custom view tailored to unmatched scenarios.
- **Fallback Content**: By specifying a `default.tsx` file, you ensure that users always see meaningful content, even when navigating to routes that do not have a direct match.

### Example

Consider a scenario where a user navigates to a dashboard section that does not exist:

- **With `default.tsx`**: The application displays a default message or UI, guiding the user back to a valid section or providing additional options.
- **Without `default.tsx`**: The application shows a 404 error, indicating that the requested content is unavailable.

By effectively using the `default.tsx` file, you can enhance the robustness of your Next.js application, providing a consistent user experience even when users navigate to unmatched routes.
